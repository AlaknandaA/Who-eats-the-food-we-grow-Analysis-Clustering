# Who-eats-the-food-we-grow-Analysis-Clustering
Using data of various types of food production from various countries, analysed how production patterns have changed over the years.

## Problem Statement:

### Context:
Our world population is expected to grow from 7.3 billion today to 9.7 billion in the year 2050. Finding solutions for feeding the growing world population has become a hot topic for food and agriculture organizations, entrepreneurs and philanthropists. These solutions range from changing the way we grow our food to changing the way we eat. To make things harder, the world's climate is changing and it is both affecting and affected by the way we grow our food â€“ agriculture. This dataset provides an insight on our worldwide food production - focusing on a comparison between food produced for human consumption and feed produced for animals.

### Content:
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations provides free access to food and agriculture data for over 245 countries and territories, from the year 1961 to the most recent update (depends on the dataset). One dataset from the FAO's database is the Food Balance Sheets. It presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period, the last time an update was loaded to the FAO database was in 2013. The food balance sheet shows for each food item the sources of supply and its utilization. This chunk of the dataset is focused on two utilizations of each food item available:

**Food** - refers to the total amount of the food item available as human food during the reference period.\
**Feed** - refers to the quantity of the food item available for feeding to the livestock and poultry during the reference period. Acknowledgements This dataset was meticulously gathered, organized and published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

### Possible questions to answer:
Find interesting outliers in the data?
What are the fastest growing countries in terms of food production\consumption?
Compare between food and feed consumption.


## Important Insights gained:

1. Worldwide production of Food for humans increased by 272% from 1961-2013, whereas that of Feed for livestock increased by 195% in the same period. Thus, Production of Food for humans increased much more than Feed for animals from 1961-2013.
2. Out of the ten items that saw the higest increase in production from 1961-2013, two are cereals and maize, which increased significantly for livestock feed purpose, especially maize. We also saw a huge increase in production on milk products, which is an animal derivative, suggesting that number of livestock greatly increased in this time period too.
3. The countries that saw highest increase in production of food-feed were China, India and USA.
* China is the largest producer of several grains and vegetables like maize, rice, wheat, potatoes, etc. due to this increase.
* India is the largest producer of sugarcane and milk, and second producer in many of the categories that China is top. It is also the largest exporter of beef.
* USA increase in food-feed production did not occur at the same pace as China's and India's. Thus, it was overtaken in many of the categories where it held top spot for production.
4. Milk products and meat are two of the ten top produced items, suggesting that livestock feed production was increased to support increase in demand of animal products. Though animal product demand increased, the primary food for most of the world population remained plants, marked by increased production of cereals for humans, vegetables, grains and fruits.

**In conclusion, production of food for humans increased much more than feed for animals from 1961-2013. The increase in feed production was for supporting increased demand for animal products.**
